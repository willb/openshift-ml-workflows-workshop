    "Suppose the spam generator becomes more intelligent and begins producing prose which looks \"more legitimate\" than before. Data drift occurs when the data the model was trained on no longer accurately reflects the data that the model is currently analyzing. Drift can take on different forms, to illustrate a few: \n",
    " + The structure of data may change. Maybe spam emails start utilizing photo attachments rather than text. Since our model is based off of text within the email, it would likely start performing very poorly.\n",
    " + Data can change meaning, even if structure does not. (example)\n",
    " + Features may change. Features that are previously infrequent may become more frequent, or vice versa. One (unlikely) drift could be that all modern spam emails begin containing the word \"coffee\" and never the word \"tree.\" This could be an important insight to include in our model. \n",
    " \n",
